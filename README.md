- To train or fine-tune detection and segmentation models, usage of GPU is recommended.
- During research, codes have been executed in Google Colab as it is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs.

## Dataset
- In this research, the dataset was manually created using a smartphone, consisting of 12 videos â€” 10 for training and 2 for testing. These videos capture conveyor belts with LEGO bricks from multiple angles with varying complexities for diversity. LEGO bricks were annotated frame-by-frame using RoboFlow (https://roboflow.com/), which was the most time-consuming step.
- Dataset is publicly available in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hbahruz/multiple-lego-tracking-dataset

## Pipeline

## Pre-trained parameters
- The folder contains .pt files of YOLOv8 and RT-DETR detection models which are the saved parameters of best YOLOv8 and best RT-DETR models represented in Lego_Results.xlsx (located under Results folder)

## Models
- Jupyter Notebook named "Fine-Tuning Detection Models" is used to fine-tune the YOLOv8 and RT-DETR and save the parameters
- data.yaml file is used in the training procedure of the detection models, which contains data path, augmentation types and other needy information
- Jupyter Notebook named "Fine-Tuned RTDETR + DeepSORT" is a combination of the Detection-Tracking pipeline. YOLOv8 can also be used instead of RT-DETR with some minor changes.

## Results
- The folder contains Lego_Results.xlsx which has all saved values during the execution of the codes
- There are also some figures underlining important points obtained from the experiments
